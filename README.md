# KotlinTus
Kotlin is one of the powerful language which runs on JVM. 
IN the first example, I demostrate about set and get the values.
2 textview defined in xml file. 
One of the advantage of kotlin is, it removes defining of findViewById. Instead of directly access the value of textview and set the values.
fun is used to define methods. fun->function.
